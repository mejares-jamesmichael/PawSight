# PawSight: Pet Behavior Guide

**PawSight** is a hybrid (online/offline) mobile application designed to help pet owners, specifically cat owners, interpret their pet's body language. It combines a robust offline library of behaviors with online AI-powered assistance (Text + Vision) and veterinary resources.

## Features

*   **Offline Behavior Library:** A comprehensive, searchable list of 15-20 common cat behaviors with descriptions and visual aids. All primary behavior data and images are bundled with the application, ensuring functionality without an internet connection.
*   **AI-Powered Assistant:** A chat interface that connects to an external n8n webhook to analyze user queries and uploaded photos using AI.
*   **Emergency Vet Hotline:** A static list of national/local vet hotlines for quick access to emergency resources.
*   **In-App Quizzes:** Simple multiple-choice quizzes to reinforce learning and test user knowledge.
